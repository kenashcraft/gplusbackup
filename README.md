* Install python3

This project uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for dependencies.
```
pip3 install --user pipenv
```
Ensure pipenv is in your path.  I had to add
`/Users/kashcraft/Library/Python/3.7/bin`
to my path.

```
pipenv install --dev
```

Download chromedriver and make sure it is in your path.
